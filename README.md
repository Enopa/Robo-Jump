# Robo-Jump

My second Unity project. Within this one I decided to experiment A LOT more. I played around with lighting, animation and sound. This project was built entirely within my free time and is the most "finished" of my projects thus far. 

## What is it?

Robo-jump is a 2D platformer where you are required to move vertically to escape rising lava. You must reach your spaceship and escape the perilous underground.
It's very basic, you play as a little glowing orange square that can move left and right, jump, dash and sprint for a while. You can also wall jump. 

There are 8 levels, all very linear in design and not too challenging, the game can be beaten in about 15 mins I'd say.

It was a lot of fun to build, also taught me a lot about things I may have to use in future projects. 


There are a lot of redundant files here because I did not know what gitignores were when I committed this all lol
